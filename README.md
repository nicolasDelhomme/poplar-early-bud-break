# poplar-early-bud-break
oreal and temperate latitudes but its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Previously we have reported the isolation and characterization of the EARLY BUD BREAK 1 (EBB1) gene, encoding an AP2/ERF transcription factor. We show here that EBB1 directly represses the poplar SVL (SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-LIKE), a MADS-box protein which was recently found to negatively regulate bud-break in Populus. We also report the identification and characterization of the EARLY BUD-BREAK 3 (EBB3) gene, which encodes another AP2/ERF transcription factor. We demonstrate that EBB3 is a positive regulator of bud-break and acts downstream of EBB1 and SVL. EBB3â€™s effect on bud-break is mediated via control of cell cycle by directly and positively regulating CYCLIND3.1 gene. Our results show the molecular architecture of a novel regulatory module that controls bud-break in poplar by controlling progression of cell cycle.
